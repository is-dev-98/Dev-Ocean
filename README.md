# Getting Started

The project uses Node 14

current is 17 but v14 has LTS until 2023
so you shouldn't have issues if the lates version is used.

NVM can be used to manage your Node version

The project uses react scripts so running and building is easy

run npm install for dependencies

npm start (local development)

npm build (prod / stage)

Basic ESlint is used with Prettier
