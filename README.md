# Getting Started

The project uses **Node 14**

current node version is 17 but v14 has LTS until 2023.
So you shouldn't have issues if the lates version is used.

**NVM** can be used to manage your Node version

# Running & Building

The project uses **react scripts** so running and building is easy

run npm install for dependencies

npm start (local development)
npm build (prod / stage)

Basic ESlint is used with Prettier

# Deployment

For simplicity sake the project is deployed on **heroku**
because it has React scripts and github integration.
That makes deployment automatic and easy.
